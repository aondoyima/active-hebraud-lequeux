## Packages needed outside of Python's standard library
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is the standard package for scientific computing with Python
- [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) provides higher level scientific computing - this project uses [fsolve](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html), which finds solutions to non-linear equations based on an inital guess 
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
